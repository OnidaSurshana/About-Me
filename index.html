  <h1>Ricardo Collymore</h1>
  <h5>Coding Student</h5>
  <p>As a student in training im creating an about me page to practice my coding and to introduce myself.
    My name is Ricardo Collymore and i want to, one day be a game designer. I grew up playing them and making them (with pre-prepared tools) and now i want to learn how to make them from scratch. I use to play in gaming tournements before becoming a coding student. I also did alot of graphic design and animation a few years back. Im definitely more of the silent type, the only thing that comes close to my love of games and art is my love of peace and quiet. I like studying mythologies. (Greek, Norse and Ejyptian in particular) I made it a habbit to use
    unknown mythological figures such as Yudi, Nǚwā, Onida ect as usernames on different platforms just to have people
    scratching their heads.
